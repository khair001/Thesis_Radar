# Thesis_Radar — Mutual Interference Characterization Using IWR6843AOP mmWave Radar

This repository contains the MATLAB code, experimental datasets, and documentation for my Master's thesis project on **mutual interference analysis** in mmWave FMCW radar systems using **Texas Instruments IWR6843AOP**.

---

## 📘 Overview
The project investigates how mutual interference between two nearby automotive radars affects range, velocity, and detection coherence.  
A novel diagnostic metric called **Average Directional Variance (ADV)** is implemented to quantify velocity decoherence caused by overlapping chirps.
